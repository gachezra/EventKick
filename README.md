# EventKick
A new project based on an [old one](github.com/gachezra/event)

# üõ†Ô∏è What's new
Well, the following:
1. More fluid design.
2. Use of [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com) instead of Vanilla CSS.
3. Adding more features as we go. 
4. Hopefully I'll find a worthy partner to assist me in this journey.

# Experiment Deploy

I will be changing the serverside language to PHP due to unavoidable circumstances. I will revert to Node and React once I get a more powerufl PC to host the site myself.
# One more thing
